    <h1>my story</h1>
</header>

<p>
    I was born & raised in Ottawa, Canada.  
</p>

<p>
    Prior to HS, my brother & I co-founded a non-profit org. At a young age, I worked in homeless shelters & interacted with city officials. Although providing meals brought temporary relief, the enduring challenge of homelessness steered my focus towards its root cause: underlying mental health issues.
</p>

<p>
    When I was 14, I worked in <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-medicine/leadership-team/dr-daniel-figeys"> Dr. Figeys Lab</a> at the University of Ottawa's Medical School doing Alzheimer's research. I was trained to work with animal models and conducted grad-level proteomics research. I impressed professors after sneaking into a medical school competition & winning first-place.
</p>

<p>
    In gr.11 & gr.12, I worked under <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-medicine/dr-richard-naud">Dr. Richard Naud</a> and was fortunate enough to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452221003808?via%3Dihub">publish</a> my deep learning / neuroscience research when I was 16. I worked on simulating the brain on a computer.
</p>
<p>
I'm now an undergrad student in applied math at Caltech, passionately exploring all facets of technology and research. My goal is to tackle major global issues and gather unique life experiences along the way.
